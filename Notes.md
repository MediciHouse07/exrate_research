Yes, you need to manage & keep the data
manage is for the purpose of keep downloading, and have a way to update the main structure cleverly
keep is referring to, no matter you will gain this data in the future, by the time you have it, you need to store it, and make sure you will not lose it, as well as lose the explainable of the data

- sort your collections
- classify them
- manage security
- store them
- maximize value routes
- some necessary crossing nw knowledge

The purpose is not to let them freeze/dull your mind
- Shortage of data, or reading materials, if this happened, you can do nothing on it, with a high probability.
